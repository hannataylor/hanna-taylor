                  Localeyes is an app that connects tourists to day trips curated by locals.
                  Localeyes is built in Rails and utilizes the Google Maps and Google Places API.
                  I worked a lot on front end, implementing Materialize CSS, a framework based
                  on Google's Material Design philosophy.  In addition to front end, I created
                  other features on the back end, such as favorites, "been there", "available for tours",
                  and mutual followers.
