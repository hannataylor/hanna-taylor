        <p>Hi! I'm Hanna and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer living in New York City.</p><br>
        <p>I love working in Ruby in Rails and everything that back end web development entails, and I also love design and working in HTML/CSS with JavaScript/jQuery and making the back end come to life.</p><br>
        <p>I'm always looking to improve my skills. I learned Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and HTML/CSS in just a few months, so I'm excited to see what I put my mind to next...PHP and Scala are definitely next on the to-learn list.</p>
