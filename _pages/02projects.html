            <p class="center">Localeyes is an app that connects tourists to day trips curated by locals. Localeyes is built in Rails and utilizes the Google Maps and Google Places API. I worked a lot on front end, implementing Materialize CSS, a framework based on Google's Material Design philosophy. In addition to front end, I created other features on the back end, such as favorites, "been there", "available for tours", and mutual followers.</p>
